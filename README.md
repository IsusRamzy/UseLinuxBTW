# UseLinuxBTW

## Do you know Linux BTW?
Linux is both an open-source Unix-like kernel and a generic name for a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,
an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.

## Idea of `UseLinuxBTW`
People who use Arch Linux (the hardest linux distro) often say 'I use Arch BTW'.  
Someone created a project called 'I Use Arch BTW' based on brainfrick programming language, that uses `i`, `use`, `arch`, `linux`, `btw`, `by`, `the`, `way`, and `gentoo`.  
You can use this language to create any program!


I liked the idea, I made something like this, and called it 'I Use Linux BTW', or UseLinuxBTW.  
With `i`, `use`, `linux`, and `btw`, you can output anything from A-Z and spaces.

## How to Install
- Download `main.py`
- Run the file then add the path of the code to the command. something like `python3 main.py mycode.linuxbtw`
